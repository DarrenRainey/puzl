puzl is a cross platform game engine.

Current supported platforms are Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, and modern web browser. Intended future platforms are Android, iOS, and XBox.

Current technologies used are OpenGL, SDL, C++, and Javascript. Intended future technologies include various Javascript engines (particularly Google's V8), Microsoft .NET, XNA, and C#.

Its emphasis is on 2D graphics. It provides sound and input via keyboard, mouse, and joystick. Networking and 3D graphics are intended for future improvements.

The overall goal is to be a framework library that allows indie developers to efficiently and effortlessly target as many platforms as possible with a single game logic code base.
